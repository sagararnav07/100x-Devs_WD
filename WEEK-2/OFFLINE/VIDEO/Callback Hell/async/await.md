Yes, we **use `async/await` instead of promise chaining** to make asynchronous code easier to read and write.

---

### 🔁 Traditional Promise Chaining:
```js
fetchData()
  .then(response => processData(response))
  .then(result => showResult(result))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

This works fine, but once you start nesting or chaining more, it can get hard to read.

---

### ✅ Using `async/await`:
```js
async function handleData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetchData();
    const result = await processData(response);
    showResult(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

Much cleaner and looks like synchronous code — **easier to follow**.

### ✨ Benefits of `async/await`:
- Improves **readability**
- Reduces **callback hell**
- Easier **error handling** using `try/catch`
- Works great with **sequential** and **parallel** async operations

Would you like a side-by-side example with real API calls or file operations to see both styles in action?
