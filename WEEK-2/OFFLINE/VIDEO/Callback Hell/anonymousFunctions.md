In JavaScript, **anonymous functions** are functions that do not have a name. These are often used when a function is passed as an argument to other functions, especially in higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`.

Here’s a breakdown of anonymous functions:

### 1. **Basic Syntax**

An anonymous function is simply a function expression without a name. It's typically defined inline where it's needed.

```javascript
// Example of an anonymous function
const sum = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

console.log(sum(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

### 2. **Arrow Functions (ES6)**

ES6 introduced arrow functions, which are a more concise way to write anonymous functions.

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

console.log(sum(2, 3)); // Outputs: 5
```

### 3. **Anonymous Functions in Callbacks**

Anonymous functions are commonly used as callbacks, particularly in asynchronous operations, event listeners, or array methods.

#### Example with `setTimeout`:
```javascript
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('This message is shown after 2 seconds');
}, 2000);
```

#### Example with `Array.map`:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map(function(num) {
    return num * num;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Outputs: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### 4. **Anonymous Functions in Event Handlers**

```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

### Benefits of Anonymous Functions:

- **Concise**: They help reduce the amount of code and are often used in places where the function doesn’t need to be reused.
- **Encapsulation**: They allow functions to be used as temporary helpers without polluting the global scope with unnecessary names.
